Hummus dip, authentic recipe.
Ingredients:
- 1.5 cups of chickpea
- Juice of one lemon
- 1 clove of garlic
- Tahini sauce (~ 1/2 a cup)
- Salt to taste

- Soak chickpeas overnight
- Boil chickpeas for about two hours (watch that they don't dry out)
- Keep some of the water from the pot as well as a handful of chickpeas
- Wait till chickpeas are cool enough to peel (this is optional but results in a good texture)
- In a blender or food processor:
   - process all the chickpeas and garlic with gradual additions of water, lemon juice and tahini
   - keep tasting as you go!
 Serve in a bowl and decorate like so:
   - With a spoon, make a groove an inch from the edge (think moat around a castle!)
   - In the groove, pour extra virgin olive oil
   - Sprinkle chilli powder to taste
   - Build a little pyramid of chickpeas in the middle and in a few places around the edge of the bowl
